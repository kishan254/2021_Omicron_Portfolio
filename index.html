            <article>
                <p class ="aboutMeBorder"> My name is Kishan Gosrani, and I am a graduate from Curtin University. I have a Double Major degree in Entrepreneurship and Accounting.
                    I currently own and operate two businesses in hospitality and automotive industries. I am learning how to code because I want to work with a technology start-up focusing on automations in the near future.
                    Being a full-stack developer comes with many advantages, advantages that not many people know or can proudly state, main one being mobility.
                    One can develop code from any where in the world, as long as there is a computer and software writing language. 

                    I have many dreams, and passions in life, to be frank, these have pushed me today for me to write this website for you. I do not know if I need a job,
                    but I can definitely be a useful asset in your company. I have entrepreneurship skills, I am great at sales, I have a firm understanding of engineering systems and business systems.
                    
                    I am writing all of this because I take this project very seriously, and I would like to thank you for taking the time to read the About me section.
